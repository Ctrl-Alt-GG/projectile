# OpenTTD scraper

Partially vibe-coded and fully ashamed of it...


I've used wireshark to figure out how querying works, then asked Copilot to find the relevant parts of the query struct in the OpenTTD source code, then write some go code for parsing it. Later I partially refactored that code and attached the relevant source code links.
